# newsOfTheWired
A mongoose/cheerio web scraper site

News of the Wired, named for an associated press feature called "News of the Weird" is a Mongo database/Mongoose/Cheerio/handlebars web scraping site. The user can save and article and comment on that article. All comments associated with that article can be read and updated. This excercise leads into react, the handlebars serving as a didactic bridge between traditional html and react. 

## How to Use

For this app the user chooses a news article from among those listed upon entering the site. He or She has the ability to click on a button and is taken to the actual article which is hosted on NPR. Once having read the news article the user can push another button to make comments on it. These comments can be updated or deleted, giving the site CRUD status. All data is stored in a Mongo database.
